# Personal Portfolio Website

## Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website aimed at showcasing my work and skills. It includes pages such as Home, About, Portfolio, and Contact. The website is designed to reflect my personal brand and professionalism while providing a user-friendly experience for visitors.

## Planning & Design

### Sketch the Layout
I began by sketching the layout of the website, focusing on creating a clean and intuitive design that highlights my work effectively.

### Decide on Style
For the color scheme, I chose a combination of muted tones with accents of vibrant colors to add visual interest without overwhelming the content. The fonts selected are clean and modern to ensure readability across different devices.

### Stretch Goal Implemented: Interactive JavaScript Elements
To enhance the user experience, I implemented interactive JavaScript elements throughout the website. This includes modal pop-ups for portfolio pieces, providing users with more details about each project without navigating away from the page.

## Development

### HTML Structure
I used semantic HTML5 to structure the website, ensuring accessibility and proper organization of content for search engines.

### CSS Styling
CSS3 was applied to style the website, focusing on creating a responsive design that looks great on all devices. Flexbox and Grid layouts were utilized to achieve a flexible and visually appealing design.

### Implementing Stretch Goal
The selected stretch goal of integrating interactive JavaScript elements was implemented during the development phase. This involved writing custom JavaScript code to create modal pop-ups for portfolio pieces, enhancing the user experience and engagement with the site.

## Testing & Debugging

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
I thoroughly tested the website across different browsers to ensure consistent performance and appearance. Compatibility was verified for popular browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

### Responsive Testing
The responsive design was tested on various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Media queries and fluid layouts were used to ensure the website adapts well to different screen sizes.

### Stretch Goal Functionality
The functionality of the implemented stretch goal was rigorously tested to ensure it functions correctly across different devices and browsers. User feedback was also collected to fine-tune the interactive elements for optimal usability.

## Deployment

### Choose a Platform
The website was deployed using GitHub Pages, providing a simple and reliable hosting solution. This ensures the site is publicly accessible and easy to update in the future.

### Publish my Site
Following the instructions provided by GitHub Pages, the website was published, and a final check was performed to ensure everything loads correctly. The implemented stretch goal feature was verified once more to ensure it enhances the user experience as intended.

## Challenges Faced
One of the main challenges faced during development was fine-tuning the responsive design to ensure consistency across various devices and screen sizes. Additionally, implementing the interactive JavaScript elements required careful planning and testing to ensure they functioned smoothly without impacting performance.
